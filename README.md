# BookStore
Description:
BookStore is a foundational full-stack application I created while learning how to build and integrate a backend with a MongoDB database and a React frontend. This project helped me understand the fundamentals of full-stack development, including setting up MongoDB schemas, managing API requests, and handling cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). It serves as a great reference point for me to refresh my understanding of full-stack development principles.

# Features:
Add books with details like title, author, and publication year.
View a list of all books stored in the database.
Update and delete books as needed.
Responsive user interface built with React.
Backend powered by Node.js and Express.js.
Database management using MongoDB.
Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
HTTP Client: Axios
Middleware: CORS
Learning Outcomes
This project taught me:

How to set up and connect a MongoDB database to a Node.js backend.
The process of creating and managing MongoDB schemas.
The fundamentals of handling RESTful API requests using Axios.
Setting up a React frontend to interact with the backend.
How to manage CORS to enable communication between the client and server.
Debugging common errors and understanding the full-stack development workflow.


# Future Plans
Add user authentication for personalized book management.
Implement book search and filter functionality.
Improve the UI with a modern design framework (e.g., Material-UI or Tailwind CSS).
Add a feature for users to leave reviews or ratings.

# Acknowledgments
This app was created following a tutorial that introduced me to full-stack development. It has been instrumental in building my confidence and understanding of key development workflows
